## Hi there I'm Andrew ðŸ‘‹

I am a student at ASU currently pursuing a Bachelorâ€™s Degree in Graphic Information Technology, with a concentration in Full Stack Web Design. 
Prior to begining the GIT program, I have studied Photography at ASUâ€™s Herberger Institute for Design and the Arts, and obtained an Associateâ€™s Degree in Small Group Management from Purdue University Global; which I obtained while serving in the Army. 

Experiences learning, using, and troubleshooting various common and proprietary systems have fueled a desire to better understand the coding languages used to design such programs and their interfaces. After graduation I aspire to combine coding with my passion for photography to create a program to aid in portfolio and project presentation. 

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning HTML and Python
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a surrealist photo project inspired by The Magnus Archives
